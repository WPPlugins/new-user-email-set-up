== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The email isn't being sent from the address I define =

Are you sure that that address exists on your host? If you use MX records, you have to set up the email address on your host as well for it to work correctly.

= My variables aren't being passed to the email =

Make sure they are in the format %variable% with no spaces between the % and the variable. 

= I'm not getting any emails sent, to me or the user! =
